# Hello, thanks for your interest in Khadaji's (Asmodeus) Aardwolf Affects Window
Here is a horrible readme. (I'll improve this later)

To install this plugin, just paste these folders over your own, and you should be good to go,

or take the files from the folders and place them in your existing folders of the same name.



There is no "intial check" for spells yet, so once spells fall, and re-up, they will display
in the window.






------------------------------------------------TO DO --------------------------------------------------------

--[[***[HIGH PRIORITY]***
on login, reconnect, etc, type aflags to check for perm sanc and other effects
check saf sanc and aflags? ^^

--check EQ on login/reconnect, etc. add string for wear/remove sanc aura/boots of speed, etc


If sanctuary is ON via some methods, and you wear the sanc aura, leave the timer and when it falls if the aura is on
change timer to PERMA

Get AARD EQ WORKING: here are some strings

Aardwolf Aura of Sanctuary stops floating around you.
