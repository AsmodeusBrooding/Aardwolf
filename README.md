# Hello, thanks for your interest in Khadaji's (Asmodeus) Aardwolf Affects Window
Here is a horrible readme. (I'll improve this later)

To install this plugin, just paste these folders over your own, and you should be good to go,

or take the files from the folders and place them in your existing folders of the same name.



There is no "intial check" for spells yet, so once spells fall, and re-up, they will display
in the window.






------------------------------------------------TO DO --------------------------------------------------------


- [x] Add grey SPELL_DOWN icons for all existing icons

- [x] Make time numbers higher than 10 minutes show green, more than 2 minutes show yellow, and under 2 minutes show red.

- [x] Fix drawing of timers when window is vertically aligned
